# Boringstagram

## About

Boringstagram is a Chrome/Firefox extension designed to make instagram - well - more boring. Its
purpose is to break some of the dark patterns that Instagram employs to keep users coming back for
more - but without compromising on any of functionality.

## Features

- Stories are hidden from the top of the feed by default
- Profile pictures are also hidden from stories
- Posts in the feed are collapsed by default, to make it deliberately less immersive and also
  quicker to browse
- The explore page is disabled by default. Never get distracted when you are trying to search for
  something ever again
- Lightweight and secure by default. This extension is curently css-only and does not read any
  specific content on the page, so you personal information is secure.

## Future ideas

- Option to hide all reels
- If you do watch a reel, having an option to disable scrolling down to the next one
- Automatically closing stories when you get the end of a person's story (instead of being endlessly
  taken to the next one)
